DJ Sems Traktor Kontrol S5/S8 Screen Mods
------------------------------------------------

This repository is all about modding your S5/S8 Screens.
All of my work is heavily based on 
https://github.com/ErikMinekus/traktor-kontrol-screens   as well as
https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/s8-s5-display-mods.288222/  (Native Instruments Forum User "Sydes").

So credits to these two awesome guys!!!

I looked at both of their great work and combined/rearranged their screens and functions so that
it bests fits my DJing style and what I would like to see on the hardware screens.

Before you do any modding, make sure to completely BACKUP your "qml" folder from Traktor and store it somewhere save, so that
you can always go back to Traktors initial Screen setup.

Please be aware that I don't take any responsibility for anything that might go wrong when using these mods.
I guess the worst thing that could happen is that the S5/S8 Screens don't show nothing after turning on the Traktor Software. If this
 happens to you, just revert your changes (by simply overwriting the files back to their original state using the BACKUP you saved before), then
 you should be fine again.
 
In order to use this mod on your S5/S8, just follow the instructions mentioned here (its more or less simply a matter of overwriting some files):
http://djtechtools.com/2016/09/23/hack-kontrol-s8s5-screens-advanced-layouts/ (but again: Backup the original files so that you can always revert back!!)

Simply download this repository, and then completely overwrite the "Screens" folder of Traktor with the "Screens" Folder of this repository.

That's about all.

Happy Modding :)
